# Programming Languages
- Computers are machines
- programs are written in a language a computer can understand

### Machine Language
- uses zeroes(0) & ones(1)
- binary language
- machine dependent
- every instruction should be written in machine language before it can be executed.
- All instructions written in other programming languages must be translated to machine code instructions.

### Assembly Language
- developed to make programming easier
- machine dependent
- introduced keywords | add, sub, max, min, . . . .
- program called "assembler" translates assembly code to machine code

# High Level Language
- new generation of programming languages
- uses english words, easy to learn
- instructions are called "statements"
- program written in a high level language is called a source program or 'source code'
- compiler or interpreter is used to translate source code to machine code

### Complier
- translates all the source code into machine code
  
```
source code -> [compiler] -> machine code -> [executor] -> output
```

### Interpreter
- translates each statement into machine code and executes it right away
```
statement -> [interpreter] -> output
```
